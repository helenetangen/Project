\chapter{Technical Description}


Since this thesis is part of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 2015, the conference has provided all the contestants with an API available on a GitHub. API's for different programming languages are provided, but the Java API will be used in this thesis. The API includes an implementation of a simple genetic algorithm, an evaluation method and ten different wind scenarios. This section will give an explanation of the provided API, display the results from a few test simulations (which will not be included in the final thesis), and discuss future work.
