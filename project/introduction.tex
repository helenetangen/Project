\noindent \textbf{Goal statement}


\begin{quote}
\textit{The project goal is to investigate the advantages of using distributed genetic algorithms to optimizing wind farm layout, i.e. solving the wind farm layout optimization problem.}
\end{quote}


\noindent \textbf{Research question 1}


\begin{quote}
\textit{Can distributed genetic algorithms improve the quality of the solution to the wind farm layout optimization problem as compared to simple genetic algorithm.}
\end{quote}


\noindent The performance of distributed genetic algorithms will be studied and compared to the performance of a simple genetic algorithm (not distributed) and to each other with goal of answering the research questions stated below.


\noindent \textbf{Research question 2}


\begin{quote}
\textit{Which distributed genetic algorithm works best for the wind farm layout optimization problem? What properties are essential for its success?}
